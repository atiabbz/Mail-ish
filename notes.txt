Improvements:
    User management forms validation

Mail
    Design a front-end
    for an email client
    that makes API calls
    to send and receive emails

Single page app with interface controlled by JavaScript to go to different sections

compose_email()
    hides emails-view by setting style.display=none
    shows compose-view by setting style.display=block
    sets all form input fields to '' to clear them out
        essentially, present a blank email form **every time** Compose button is clicked

load_mailbox('which_mailbox?')
    shows emails-view
    hides compose-view
    mailboxes: inbox, sent, archive
    display name of selected mailbox by updating innerHTML of emails.view (capfirst)

need to implement
    showing emails in
        inbox, sent, archive mailboxes
    view to show contents of an email
    sending email on compose form submit

GET /emails/<str:mailbox>
    returns all emails in a mailbox
